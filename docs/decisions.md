# Decisions

conformIT's own record, kept to the standard it defines in
[documentation-standard.md](documentation-standard.md). Numbered, stable,
never reused. A reversed decision gets a new entry; the old one stays.

## 1. Conventional Commits is the standard, not the slug format

Two incompatible conventions existed across the surveyed repos:

- `novak/docs/commit-style.md`: Conventional Commits, hook-enforced, with a
  full type table and a documented rationale.
- `anjunatree/CONTRIBUTING.md`: lowercase hyphenated slugs
  (`feature-personal-constellation`), explicitly "no scope parentheses,"
  subject reads as a slug rather than a sentence.

**Chosen:** Conventional Commits.

**Why:** it is machine-readable, which makes changelog generation and
semantic versioning available later at no cost now. The slug format is
readable but parses to nothing. novak's version also already carries the
reasoning for the body conventions, which are the part that actually
matters.

**What it cost:** anjunatree's format is genuinely tidier to read in a
`git log --oneline`, and its author preferred it deliberately, not by
default. Subjects get longer. One repo's documented convention is
overridden by a cross-cutting standard, which is a real cost the first time
it happens and sets the precedent for every later conflict.

**What would justify revisiting:** if changelog generation and semver are
still unimplemented in a year, the machine-readability argument was
theoretical and the tidier format should win.

**Still open:** whether anjunatree migrates at all. See #2.

## 2. Existing repos are audited, never retroactively migrated

`scripts/conform.sh audit` reports divergence. It does not rewrite, and
there is no `--fix`.

**Why:** rewriting a working repo to satisfy a standard is a large diff with
no functional change, it destroys `git blame`, and it front-loads all the
cost of a standard before any of its benefit. Conformance is worth having
going forward. It is rarely worth a migration.

**What it cost:** the repos stay inconsistent, possibly for a long time. An
audit that nobody acts on is just a list. anjunatree in particular will have
non-conforming history indefinitely.

**Rejected:** an autofix mode. It would be used once, on the wrong repo, at
the wrong time.

**What would justify revisiting:** a repo being prepared for publication,
where inconsistency is externally visible.

## 3. Dual licence: CC BY 4.0 for prose, MIT for everything else

**Why:** the two halves have different purposes. The standards are meant to
be read, cited, and adapted, and attribution should survive that; CC BY is
built for it. The templates and hooks are meant to be copied into someone
else's repo, and a copyleft or attribution obligation riding along into
their codebase would stop people using them.

**What it cost:** a two-licence repo is more complicated to explain than a
one-licence repo, and someone will eventually copy a doc under the
impression it's MIT. The `README` states the split explicitly to reduce
that.

**Rejected:** MIT throughout (attribution on prose is the point, and MIT's
attribution requirement is aimed at source files). CC BY throughout (a bad
fit for code, and CC explicitly advises against it for software).

## 4. Rules are derived from repeated practice, and cite their source

A rule enters the standard only if it is either (a) observed working in more
than one existing project, or (b) a deliberate new decision recorded here
with its reasoning. Inline citations name the file it came from.

**Why:** the difference between a standard and a preference is evidence.
The citations let a reader judge each rule independently instead of
accepting or rejecting the set, and they make it obvious when a rule is one
project's habit generalised too eagerly.

**What it cost:** the documents are longer and more cluttered with paths
than a clean set of assertions would be. Some genuinely good ideas are
excluded for having only one instance behind them.

**Still open:** whether the citations should be stripped for the public
release, since they point at repos an outside reader cannot see. Current
answer is no. A reader who cannot verify a source can at least see that one
was claimed, and see which rules have none.

## 5. Every rule states its cost

**Why:** a rule that reads as free gets ignored the first time it isn't.
Naming the cost up front means the trade-off was made deliberately, and
gives anyone departing from a rule a stated basis for doing so.

**What it cost:** roughly a third of the word count, and it makes the
standards less quotable.

**Still open:** rule 9 of the Rules of Engagement claims a cost of "none."
Two design principles do the same. If several rules are genuinely free, the
convention is weaker than it looks and those may just be well-chosen. VERIFY
against real use.

## 6. Every project discloses LLM use and states a status

Added after direct instruction from the maintainer, not derived from the
surveyed repos: none of the nine currently does this.

**Why:** a reader deciding whether to trust or adopt a project shouldn't
have to guess how it was built, or whether it's ready to rely on. Both are
facts about the project that the code itself doesn't reveal, which is
exactly the kind of thing this whole standard exists to make explicit rather
than implicit.

**Why "in testing" is the default, not an option:** an unstated status reads
as an implicit claim of stability. Requiring the maintainer to actively
declare "stable" moves the burden of proof onto the claim that needs it.

**What it cost:** a small amount of README real estate on every project,
including ones where the answer is obvious to the maintainer. It isn't
obvious to a new reader, which is the point.

**What would justify revisiting:** nothing so far. This is a disclosure
requirement, not a technical trade-off, and disclosure requirements don't
generally have a cost side worth weighing against.

## 7. Em dashes are banned, and AI-sounding prose is a review target

Added alongside #6, same source.

**Why:** rule 2 of [documentation-standard.md](documentation-standard.md)
requires disclosing LLM involvement. Prose that reads as unreviewed AI
output undercuts that disclosure. It signals the opposite of what the
disclosure is meant to convey, which is that a human is accountable for
what's written.

**What it cost:** every document in this repository had to be rewritten
after the fact. At the time this rule was added, a grep across `docs/` and
`README.md` found 108 em dashes. Writing the standards and then failing them
immediately is embarrassing, and is recorded here rather than quietly
fixed, per [rules-of-engagement.md](rules-of-engagement.md) rule 4.

**What would justify revisiting:** if the em-dash rule turns out to be
theater and the softer style guidance in
[writing-style.md](writing-style.md) does the real work on its own, the hard
rule could be dropped. No evidence either way yet.

## 8. Telegraphic status fragments are a named anti-pattern

Follow-up to #7, flagged by the maintainer against a real example from
another project: a status note compressed into label-fragments and
semicolon-spliced clauses with no subjects, reading like internal shorthand
rather than something a person wrote for another person.

**Why:** dropping this rule into the general "avoid the tells" list in
[writing-style.md](writing-style.md) would have buried it. The maintainer's
example was specific enough, and different enough from the em-dash problem,
to earn its own section with a worked before/after.

**What it cost:** a re-scan of every existing document for the pattern. It
turned out clean; nothing in `docs/` used standalone label-fragments, and
the semicolons already present all join full independent clauses rather
than dropped-subject shorthand, so no rewrite was needed this time. Worth
noting because the em-dash rule (#7) did require a full rewrite and this
one didn't; the two failures aren't equally likely to recur.

**What would justify revisiting:** if this turns out to be the same
underlying problem as #7 (unreviewed first-draft output) rather than a
distinct pattern, the two sections could merge.

## 9. One standard for humans and models, not a model standard with a human exemption

Prompted by the maintainer correcting the framing of
[rules-of-engagement.md](rules-of-engagement.md), which originally read
"written at the model, but they bind the human too."

**Why:** that phrasing put the model first and treated human compliance as
an afterthought, which is backwards from the actual point. The whole
premise of this project is that good practice doesn't change based on who
is typing. A rule that only an AI needs isn't an engineering standard, it's
a leash, and this project isn't building one of those.

**What it cost:** a rewrite of the opening of
[rules-of-engagement.md](rules-of-engagement.md). Small, but worth
recording because the original framing was wrong on a point the whole
project depends on, not a style nit.

**What would justify revisiting:** if a genuinely AI-specific rule turns up
that has no human equivalent (something about context windows or session
boundaries, say), it still belongs in this document, but should be marked
as such rather than implied to be universal when it isn't.

## 10. conformIT is exempt from part of its own required-file list

Prompted by the `novak` audit (novak PR #29, the first external application
of this standard), which ran `documentation-standard.md`'s required-file
list against this repo and found `CLAUDE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`docs/architecture.md`, `docs/security.md`, and `docs/credits.md` all
absent. The audit's own text flagged this as something needing a decision
rather than a silent gap, which is the right instinct: an unrecorded
divergence from your own rule is exactly the kind of thing
[documentation-standard.md](documentation-standard.md) exists to prevent.

**Chosen:** `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/security.md`, and
`docs/credits.md` do not apply here and are not planned. `CLAUDE.md` and
`CHANGELOG.md` do apply and are open gaps, tracked in
[STATE.md](STATE.md), not exemptions.

**Why:** the first three assume a system with running components, trust
boundaries, and dependencies to declare. This repo is prose plus two git
hooks. `architecture.md` would describe two files calling each other.
`security.md` would restate `security-posture.md` with no project-specific
instance to add. `credits.md` would be a near-empty table, since the whole
point of the survey method (decision-in-progress, see the provenance
section of the README) is that the standards are derived from patterns
already observed, not built on adopted dependencies. `CLAUDE.md` and
`CHANGELOG.md` have no such argument: this repo has AI-assisted commits
that would benefit from a working agreement, and it has released versions
worth a changelog once tagging starts.

**What it cost:** the required-file list in `documentation-standard.md`
now reads as universal when three of its nine entries are conditional. That
was already implicit for `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `VISION.md`, which the same
document already marks as conditional; this makes explicit that
"required" was never meant to be read as "every file, every repo."

**What would justify revisiting:** if conformIT ever adopts a real
dependency (a linter, a CI action, a package this repo requires rather
than one it's documenting), `docs/credits.md` becomes real and this
decision narrows to cover only `architecture.md` and `security.md`.

## 11. The commit-msg hook's non-imperative check was missing two of three shapes

Found by diffing an adopting project's independently-extended fork of this
same hook against the template it started from (novak PR #29 and #30),
rather than by anyone auditing the template directly.

**What was wrong:** the template only matched past tense ("added") and
gerunds ("adding"), and only for five verbs. Third-person present forms
("adds," "fixes," "removes," "creates") passed silently, because they were
never in the list at all. novak's own hook, forked from an earlier version
of this template, already had the third-person forms; the audit in PR #29
found the template lacked the capitalisation and gerund checks novak's
hook had gained since, and in porting those back (PR #30) surfaced that
the direction ran both ways: novak's fork was ahead on third-person forms
before this project ever asked about them.

**Chosen:** extended the word list to cover all three shapes, plus two
verbs (`create`, `refactor`) that weren't in either version but are common
enough to matter, since `refactor` is also a commit type and easy to type
as the description's first word by habit.

**Why a bug like this survived:** the hook was tested against a
regression matrix at the time it was written (11 cases, later 14), and
every case passed. None of the cases exercised third-person present tense,
because the person writing the tests was also the person who wrote the
word list, and both omissions were the same blind spot. An external
fork that grew independently didn't share it.

**What it cost:** nothing to fix. The finding itself is the interesting
part: a hardcoded word list is the kind of check that looks complete when
you write it and stays that way until an independent implementation shows
you what it missed. Worth remembering the next time this hook's list
looks finished.

**What would justify revisiting:** if the word list keeps growing verb by
verb, it may be worth switching to a general "does this look like a
third-person-singular or gerund verb" pattern instead of an enumerated
list, at the cost of more false positives on words that happen to end in
"s" or "ing" without being verbs at all.

## 12. A recurring, centralized audit, scoped to a declared list of public repos

The maintainer asked for a recurring GitHub Actions audit of the projects
adopting this standard, with a readable pass/fail report. This resolves
part of the open question in STATE.md about whether conformIT installs
into projects or stays a reference: for auditing specifically, the answer
is reference. Nothing is installed into any target; conformIT clones each
one fresh, checks it from outside, and throws the clone away.

**Chosen:**

- A declared list (`registry/targets.yaml`), not auto-discovery of
  everything under an account. Auto-discovery would need to guess which
  repos are actually meant to follow this standard and would silently
  change scope every time a new repo appeared.
- Public repos only. A private target needs a deploy key or a PAT with
  read access, which this workflow doesn't have and doesn't ask for. Not
  a technical limit, a deliberate one: adding cross-repo credentials to a
  scheduled workflow is a real security-posture decision on its own
  (rule 4, identity and scope), not a side effect of wanting a report.
- Output goes to the GitHub Actions job summary only. No commit, no
  issue. Chosen over both alternatives specifically because the
  maintainer flagged wanting the report to exclude anything private or
  secret; a job summary that's regenerated every run and never persisted
  to git or to an issue thread is the smallest surface for something to
  leak into by accident. The checks themselves only ever print filenames,
  line numbers, and short labels, never file contents, for the same
  reason: some of what's audited is a repository this project doesn't
  own, and the report about it is more public than the repository itself
  needs to be aware of.
- The job always exits successfully, regardless of findings. This is a
  report, not a gate, consistent with decision #2 (audit reports, never
  rewrites, never blocks). A red status badge would invite treating a
  finding as a build failure to fix under pressure rather than a fact to
  read.
- `scripts/conform.sh audit` does triple duty: a local path, an
  `owner/repo` shorthand (clones it), or `--all` (reads the registry).
  One command and one check implementation
  (`scripts/lib/audit-checks.sh`) for all three, rather than a separate
  CI-only script duplicating the same logic, which is the same
  reuse-before-you-add argument as rules-of-engagement rule 7 applied to
  this project's own tooling.

**What it cost:**

- The em-dash scan in `scripts/lib/audit-checks.sh` duplicates the
  fence/inline-code/allow-marker exclusion logic already in
  `templates/.githooks/pre-commit`, rather than sharing it. Deliberate:
  the pre-commit hook is meant to be dropped into a repo as one
  self-contained file, and the audit runs from conformIT's own checkout
  against a clone it doesn't control, so neither side can assume the
  other's files are present to source from. The two copies must be kept
  in sync by hand, which is a real, ongoing cost, and was already
  visible during testing: the check briefly leaked full CI temp-directory
  paths into its own report until caught and fixed in the same session
  (see the file-path handling in `_conformit_scan_em_dash`'s caller).
- The README status and LLM-disclosure checks are regex heuristics, not
  a real reading of the text. Run against the five real targets during
  development, `almadon/novak-konzol` and `almadon/consigliere` both
  failed the LLM-disclosure check although both are AI-assisted projects;
  whether that's the standard correctly catching an undisclosed project
  or the heuristic missing phrasing it should have caught wasn't
  distinguished, and reading the actual READMEs is the only way to tell.
  Treat a FAIL from these two checks as "go look," not as a
  confirmed violation.
- ~~`actions/checkout@v4` in the workflow is a floating major-version
  tag, marked `VERIFY` because this session had no way to confirm a
  current, correct SHA without network access.~~ **Resolved the same
  day, in the session that added decision #13**: that claim was wrong,
  not just cautious. This environment does have network access; the
  real commit was confirmed with `gh api repos/actions/checkout/git/refs/tags/v4`
  and pinned. Kept here rather than deleted, per
  [rules-of-engagement.md](rules-of-engagement.md) rule 4, since a wrong
  assumption about tool access is worth not repeating on the next one.
- The commit-style check counts conformance over the last 50 commits,
  which penalizes a repo for history that predates this standard
  entirely. `flashctrl/flashDK` scored 14/40 in testing for exactly this
  reason: it's a real, working project with its own prior convention,
  not evidence it's failing to adopt anything. The report doesn't
  distinguish "never adopted this" from "adopted it recently, older
  history remains," and can't from the outside.

**What would justify revisiting:** a private repo needing coverage (would
need the deploy-key question answered directly, not defaulted around);
the heuristic false-fail rate turning out high enough that the two
disclosure checks do more harm than good as an automated signal, in which
case they'd become documentation-only guidance rather than a checked item.

## 13. Sensitive-content scanning, with one deliberate exception to report-only

The maintainer asked for the audit to flag leaked secrets, personal email
addresses (excluding git-author ones), and private-service URLs, and to
warn collaborators/org members to rotate anything found.

**Chosen:**

- **Secrets**: [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks) (MIT) when
  it's on `PATH`, since a maintained rule set beats hand-rolled regex for
  something this consequential; a heuristic fallback (well-known key
  formats only: AWS access keys, PEM private-key headers, GitHub/Slack/
  Google/Stripe token prefixes) when it isn't, reported as reduced
  coverage rather than presented as equivalent. CI installs a pinned,
  checksum-verified copy; see `docs/credits.md`, created by this decision.
- **Emails**: every tracked file scanned for email-shaped strings; an
  address already in this repo's own git author/committer history is
  exempted (already public by the nature of a public git repo, per the
  maintainer's own framing), as are `noreply@` addresses and RFC 2606
  example domains.
- **Private URLs**: RFC 1918 ranges and common internal-DNS suffixes
  (`.internal`, `.corp`, `.lan`, `.ts.net`), excluding loopback addresses
  and the RFC 5737 documentation ranges, both of which are expected in
  ordinary docs and not a leak.
- **A new severity tier, CRIT**, used only for secrets. PASS/WARN/FAIL
  from decision #12 all stay report-only; a CRIT finding makes
  `scripts/conform.sh audit` exit 2, and makes the scheduled workflow
  job itself fail, breaking the "always green" rule #12 established.
  Deliberate: a red status badge on a scheduled run is one of the only
  mechanisms this design has for demanding attention beyond the summary
  text, and a live credential is exactly the class of finding worth
  interrupting someone for. Emails and private URLs stay at FAIL, not
  CRIT: real disclosure risks, but not ones with an active "rotate now"
  response the way a credential has.
- The rotate-and-notify instruction is in the report text itself, not
  just in this document: any CRIT finding prints "rotate it immediately
  and notify every collaborator or org member with access," inline,
  since that's the whole point of flagging it at all.
- Scans the whole tracked tree (`git ls-files`), not just `docs/` and
  `README.md` the way the em-dash check does. A leaked key is at least as
  likely in source or config as in prose.

**What it cost:**

- Only the current working tree is scanned, not git history. A secret
  removed from HEAD in a later commit but still present in an earlier
  one is a real, separate risk this doesn't catch, and can't from a
  shallow `--depth 50` clone even if it tried. Worth stating plainly
  rather than implying broader coverage than exists: if HEAD is clean,
  that is not the same claim as "this repo has never leaked anything."
- `docs/decisions.md` #10 exempted `docs/credits.md` for this repo on the
  premise that conformIT adopts no real dependencies. gitleaks is now
  one, which is exactly the condition #10 named as ending the exemption.
  `docs/credits.md` now exists, narrowing #10 to `docs/architecture.md`
  and `docs/security.md` only, precisely as #10 predicted.
- The gitleaks install step in the workflow is a second pinned external
  artifact (the first being `actions/checkout`), each a maintenance
  surface: both need re-verification on any future version bump, by
  someone who can actually download and checksum the new release, not by
  editing the pinned values on trust.
- Local runs of `scripts/conform.sh audit` never install anything onto
  the operator's own machine, including gitleaks: silently downloading
  and running a new binary on a user's Mac as a side effect of an audit
  command crosses a line CI installing it into an ephemeral, throwaway
  runner does not. This means local audits without gitleaks pre-installed
  get the weaker heuristic path, asymmetric with what CI sees for the
  same repo.
- All three checks are heuristic to some degree, email and URL detection
  entirely so. A regex match is not a semantic read; treat a FAIL as
  "go look," and a clean scan as "nothing obvious found," never as a
  compliance certificate. Stated directly in security-posture.md rule 9,
  which this decision also added.
- **Confirmed, not hypothetical**: running this against
  `flashctrl/flashDK` flagged `10.0.10.21` in an example file's doc
  comment as a private address. Checked the actual source: it's a
  placeholder LAN IP in a usage example telling a user to point the demo
  at their own device, not a disclosed real address. The private-URL
  check has no way to tell "example IP a reader is meant to replace"
  apart from "an address that describes real infrastructure," and this
  is exactly the false-positive shape that gap produces. Left as a FAIL
  rather than special-cased, since narrowing the pattern to dodge this
  one case risks missing a real one shaped the same way; noted here so a
  human reads the hit rather than trusting the label.
- **A related, narrower false positive was fixed, not just documented**:
  this same check flagged its own bullet point above, since
  `docs/decisions.md` quotes `10.0.10.21` inside a discussion of the
  finding. The email, private-URL, and secret-heuristic scanners never
  had the fenced-code/inline-code/allow-marker exclusions
  `_conformit_scan_em_dash` already had, so any markdown file legitimately
  illustrating a pattern always tripped its own check. Fixed by adding
  `_conformit_prose_or_raw`, the same exclusion logic applied to a shared
  helper the three scanners now pipe through, for `.md` files only. This
  does not, and isn't meant to, help the flashDK case above: that hit is
  in a `.rs` doc comment, and there's no "this is just an example"
  convention in source code the way there is in prose for this check to
  key off. Found and fixed in the same session as the rest of this
  decision, before anything was committed, by running the tool against
  its own output rather than by inspection, the same way the two bugs
  during initial testing (the trap and the leaked temp path, both
  documented in the commit history around decision #12) were found.

**What would justify revisiting:** a real false-positive or false-negative
rate observed from actual use, once the workflow has run enough times to
have one, and the flashDK example above is already one data point toward
that; a private repo needing this coverage, which would need the
gitleaks-install-locally question answered on purpose rather than
avoided; git-history scanning, if working-tree-only coverage turns out to
miss findings people actually cared about.

## 14. A copyable README scaffold, not just a described structure

The maintainer asked for standardized scaffolding for a repo's README
content and style: name, description, function, use case(s), development
status with a no-warranty disclaimer, LLM disclosure.

**Chosen:** [`templates/docs/README.md`](../templates/docs/README.md), a
fill-in-the-blank file with bracketed placeholders and inline instructions,
rather than only describing the structure in prose. `documentation-
standard.md` gained a new "What a README opens with" section (name,
one-line description, function, use cases) ahead of the existing
disclosure section, which itself gained a warranty-disclaimer requirement
alongside status and LLM use. The audit gained one more heuristic check:
a use-case section heading, at WARN rather than FAIL, since detecting a
genuinely good one-line description mechanically isn't reliable enough to
fail a repo over.

**Why a template file, not just prose:** [design-principles.md](design-principles.md)
rule 4 argues for keeping the interesting decision in one obvious, copyable
place rather than a description someone reconstructs each time. A prose
description of a README's shape is exactly the kind of thing that drifts
in the retelling; a file with placeholders doesn't.

**What it cost:** the name/description/function/use-case requirements
aren't checked as rigorously as status/warranty/LLM-use, since "is this a
good description" isn't something a regex can judge. Presence of a use-
case heading is checked; the quality of what's under it isn't and can't
be, by this kind of tool.

**What would justify revisiting:** if `conform.sh init` gets built, it
should place this file directly rather than leaving it for a human to
copy by hand; until then, copying it manually is the whole mechanism.

## 15. AGENTS.md over CLAUDE.md, and Assisted-by over Co-Authored-By

Prompted by the maintainer asking whether external standards exist for
AI-assisted work, and then asking to adopt two of the findings.

**Chosen, part one:** `AGENTS.md` is the required agent-instructions
file (`documentation-standard.md`'s table), not `CLAUDE.md`. `CLAUDE.md`
becomes a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import, Anthropic's own documented
pattern, per `templates/AGENTS.md` and `templates/CLAUDE.md`.

**Why:** [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md) is a real, converged, tool-
agnostic standard: over 60,000 adopting projects, 30+ supporting agents,
stewarded by the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation since December
2025. Writing a Claude-specific file as this project's required standard
would mean every other agent (Codex, Copilot, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Aider)
reads nothing, which contradicts decision #9's whole point: one standard
for whoever does the work, not a standard for one vendor's tool. Claude
Code itself doesn't read `AGENTS.md` natively as of this writing
([anthropics/claude-code#6235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/6235)),
so a bare `AGENTS.md` alone would leave Claude Code sessions in this
repo without it; the one-line `CLAUDE.md` import closes that gap without
maintaining two copies of the same content.

**What it cost:** every prior reference to `CLAUDE.md` as the required
file, across `documentation-standard.md`, the audit checker, `STATE.md`,
and `README.md`, needed updating in the same change; a partial rename
would have left the standard internally inconsistent, exactly the
failure mode decision #12's "credits.md never got its footnote" already
demonstrated once. The audit gained one more check: a `CLAUDE.md` with
real content and no sibling `AGENTS.md` is flagged, since that's the
most likely way a Claude Code user misses this convention entirely
(Claude Code works fine reading `CLAUDE.md` directly, so nothing forces
the tool-agnostic file into existence on its own).

**Chosen, part two:** AI-authored commits carry `Assisted-by:
AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION`, not `Co-Authored-By:`. Full format and
reasoning in
[commit-and-history.md](commit-and-history.md#ai-authorship).

**Why:** the [Linux kernel's own documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/process/coding-assistants.html)
specifies this format, and Fedora, Rocky Linux, OpenTelemetry, the
Apache Software Foundation, LLVM, and QEMU have converged on the same or
a near-identical trailer independently. `Co-Authored-By:` is GitHub's
convention for a human collaborator; using it for a tool blurs a
distinction that matters most exactly where it's blurred, which is
provenance and DCO certification. Converging on the same trailer other
projects use is also what makes `git log --grep '^Assisted-by:'`
meaningful across projects, not just within one.

**What it cost:** every commit in this project's own history before this
decision used `Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 5 <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
Not rewritten; rewriting history for a trailer format isn't worth the
disruption, and decision #2's own argument against retroactive migration
applies here too. Commits from this point forward carry both trailers in
this specific repository, not by choice: the Claude Code harness this
project has been built with requires a `Co-Authored-By:` trailer on
every commit it makes, a constraint on the tool, not a project decision.
`Assisted-by:` is added alongside it, and a project not built inside a
harness with that requirement should use only `Assisted-by:`, per
`commit-and-history.md`.

**What would justify revisiting:** if `AGENTS.md` loses adoption to a
successor the way `.cursorrules` and other tool-specific files have
already been superseded by `AGENTS.md` itself; if a coding-agent harness
starts requiring its own conflicting trailer the way this project's
current one requires `Co-Authored-By:`, in which case the "both
trailers" accommodation would need to generalize past a single special
case.

## 16. A private reporting repo, split by audience, not just relocated

Prompted by the maintainer asking whether reports should go to a private
"meta" repo instead of conformIT's own public job summary.

**Chosen:** `almadon/conformIT-reporting`, private, gets the full
per-finding detail (one file per target, overwritten each run so its own
git history is the trend record). conformIT's own public job summary
keeps only the summary table: pass/warn/fail/crit counts, no per-finding
samples. `scripts/conform.sh audit --all` gained a `--detail-dir <dir>`
flag to produce this split; without it, behaviour is unchanged (detail
and summary both to stdout, the useful shape for a human running this
locally).

**Why a split, not just a relocation:** moving the exact same combined
report to a private repo would fix exposure for repos in the registry,
but conformIT's own public job summary would stay a place a sample could
leak from, for any future check that isn't as careful as the current
ones. Splitting by audience closes that structurally rather than relying
on every check remembering to redact.

**Found while building this, fixed in the same change:** the email
check was the one place that hadn't learned this lesson yet. It printed
the actual discovered address as its "sample," unlike the secrets check
(file:line:rule, never the matched value) and the private-URL check
(file:line only). Fixed to match: redacted to file:line, regardless of
which report it ends up in. This was a live gap in the *public* job
summary this whole time, not a hypothetical one the private repo
happened to also fix.

**The credential:** a fine-grained GitHub PAT, scoped to
`almadon/conformIT-reporting` only, `contents: write`, nothing else,
stored as `CONFORMIT_REPORTING_TOKEN` in conformIT's repo secrets. The
maintainer is adding this themselves rather than it being minted by an
agent session; the publish step checks for it (via a job-level env var,
since [GitHub's own docs](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
confirm secrets can't be referenced directly in a step's `if:`, caught
by checking the docs rather than assumed) and is skipped, not failed,
until it exists.

**What it cost:** a second credentialed surface (the first being the
gitleaks download in decision #13), reviewed against
[security-posture.md](security-posture.md) rule 2: one credential, this
integration only, write access to nothing but this one repo. The
reporting repo itself has none of conformIT's own required-file set
(`AGENTS.md`, `docs/decisions.md`, and so on): it's entirely machine-
written output with no human-authored content to speak to, the same
"data, not documentation" exemption `documentation-standard.md` already
gives `prompts/`/`registry/`-shaped content, applied to a whole repo
instead of a directory within one. Its own README says so, so a visitor
doesn't wonder why it doesn't follow conformIT's own rules.

**Verified the same day, once the credential existed**: triggered the
workflow by hand (`gh workflow run`) rather than waiting for Monday. Full
green run including the publish step; `almadon/conformIT-reporting` got
a real commit with all six report files and a correctly regenerated
README index; the secrets check used the real `gitleaks` engine in CI,
not the local heuristic fallback, confirming the pinned install works on
GitHub's actual infrastructure and not just in a local reproduction; the
`HAVE_REPORTING_TOKEN` job-level env var evaluated to `true` in the job
logs, confirming the fix made after catching the wrong `if: secrets.X`
draft against GitHub's own docs. Before this, verified: the
`--detail-dir` split's content shapes, tested against all six live
targets; the redacted email check, against a synthetic fixture; the
reporting repo's own initial commit and push, done by hand rather than
through the workflow.

One non-blocking finding from the real run's own annotations: GitHub
flagged the pinned `actions/checkout` SHA as targeting the deprecated
Node 20 runtime, auto-forced onto Node 24 as a compatibility shim for
now. Nothing failed. **Bumped the same day**, once asked: `v4` to `v7`
(v7.0.1, latest release at the time). Checked before pinning, not
assumed from the version number, that `action.yml` at that commit
actually declares `using: node24`. Also checked the intervening release
notes (v5 through v7) for anything that would break this workflow's
plain, input-less checkout: the only behavioural change (v7 blocking
fork-PR checkout for `pull_request_target`/`workflow_run`) doesn't apply
to a `schedule`/`workflow_dispatch`-triggered job. Two majors in one
jump rather than stepping through v5 and v6 individually, since nothing
in between was itself worth pinning to on its own. Triggered a real run
immediately after to check the annotation actually disappeared rather
than trusting the version bump alone: it did, `annotations_count: 0` on
the resulting check run, checked directly against the API rather than
just reading the log for the absence of a warning.

**Found by running conformIT's own audit against its own working tree
right after writing the new workflow step, fixed in the same change**:
the email check flagged `actions@users.noreply.github.com`, the bot
identity this same workflow step sets for its own commits, since the
existing `noreply@*` exclusion only matched a literal prefix and GitHub's
own noreply convention puts the marker in the domain
(`*@users.noreply.github.com`), not the local part. Fixed by adding
`*@*.noreply.github.com` to the exclusion list. Worth noting because it's
the second time in one feature that a check flagged conformIT's own
output back at itself (the first was decisions.md quoting its own
example IP, in decision #13). Dogfooding immediately keeps finding
these, which is the argument for continuing to do it rather than
trusting a check because it looks reasonable on paper.

**What would justify revisiting:** if `--detail-dir`'s output ever needs
to differ from the plain stdout shape beyond "same content, different
destination," at which point a single shared code path stops being the
right design.

## 17. A reusable workflow, not a GitHub App, so any org can adopt this for itself

The maintainer asked how to make the audit/reporting setup portable to
other organizations (flashCtrl named as the example), and specifically
whether it should be a GitHub App.

**Chosen:** `.github/workflows/reusable-audit.yml`, `on: workflow_call`,
parameterized by `targets` (optional inline list), `reporting_repo`
(required), and `reporting_token` (optional secret, publish step skips
without it). conformIT's own `audit.yml` becomes a thin caller of it,
same-repo relative reference, no ref needed. An external org calls it by
`owner/repo@<pinned-ref>` from their own thin wrapper workflow, with
their own registry, their own reporting repo, their own credential.
`scripts/conform.sh audit --all` gained `--targets-file <path>` to make
this possible; the argument parser for `--all` was rewritten as a proper
flag loop to accommodate it alongside `--detail-dir` in any combination.

**Why not a GitHub App:** an App earns its cost when one identity needs
write access into *many different orgs'* repos at once, installed and
revoked per-org through GitHub's own UI. That's not this. In the
distributed model the maintainer described, each org runs its own copy,
in its own Actions, with its own credential; conformIT never holds
flashCtrl's token, and flashCtrl never holds anyone else's. Adding a
GitHub App here would mean hosting something (or at minimum, holding an
App private key somewhere to mint installation tokens), and would
concentrate exactly the kind of cross-org credential surface
security-posture.md rule 2 already argues against, worse than today's
design, not better. A GitHub App becomes the right tool only if the
model changes to genuinely centralized, one-pipeline-many-orgs auditing,
which is a different product built on a different trust relationship,
not an incremental step from this one.

**Two real bugs caught by checking documentation before writing code,
not by running it and finding out:**

1. A bare `actions/checkout` inside a called reusable workflow checks
   out the *caller's* repo by default, not the repo the reusable
   workflow itself lives in. Confirmed against GitHub's own docs before
   writing the checkout step; an earlier instinct (skip verifying,
   assume default checkout means "checkout yourself") would have shipped
   a workflow that silently checked out whatever the caller happened to
   have, for external callers specifically, the one case where being
   wrong actually breaks something. Fixed with `job.workflow_repository`
   / `job.workflow_sha`, GitHub's documented answer for exactly this.
2. `inputs.targets` and `secrets.reporting_token` are passed through
   `env:` in every step that uses them, never interpolated directly into
   a `run:` block. A `${{ inputs.targets }}` spliced straight into shell
   text is a real injection surface for an external caller's own input,
   not a hypothetical one; routing it through an environment variable
   means a crafted value is text a variable holds, not text the shell
   parses.

**What it cost:** every external adopter now depends on conformIT
itself as pinned infrastructure, the same way conformIT depends on
`actions/checkout` and `gitleaks`. If conformIT's reusable workflow
changes in a breaking way, an adopter pinned to an old tag is protected;
an adopter on `@main` is not, and nothing here can enforce which one
they choose. The `targets` input, when used, means an external org's
list lives inline in their own workflow YAML rather than in a
separately versioned file the way `registry/targets.yaml` is for
conformIT itself; a real, accepted asymmetry between the two calling
patterns, not an oversight.

This applies to *additive*, non-breaking changes too, not just breaking
ones, and it showed up almost immediately: decision #18 (the semgrep
SAST check) landed after `v2` was already cut and referenced by
flashDK's PR, with no tag bump alongside it. A pin doesn't just protect
against breakage; it also silently withholds every new check added
after it, whether or not the new check would have broken anything. Cut
`v3` and bumped every reference (the template, this README, flashDK's
PR) once this was noticed, but noticed only because the maintainer
asked directly whether existing deployments needed anything, not
because tagging a new feature is currently forced or checked. There is
no automation yet ensuring a feature commit gets a version bump; that's
a real, currently-manual discipline this project asks of itself and of
every downstream reference to it.

**What would justify revisiting:** if a genuinely centralized use case
shows up later (see "why not a GitHub App" above); if an adopter with a
long target list finds the inline-string `targets` input awkward enough
to want a file-based alternative, at which point a second input mode
(a path checked out from the caller's own repo, which needs its own
checkout step and was deliberately not built now to avoid the
ambiguity that already had to be resolved once for conformIT's own
checkout) would be worth the added complexity.

### Addendum: forking, checked against double-work first

The maintainer asked directly whether adding fork-based adoption on top
of the reusable-workflow model was redundant with it. It isn't: the two
serve different depths of adoption. Referencing `almadon/conformIT`
directly gets you the standards as-is, unmodified, upgraded by bumping a
pin. Forking gets you your own copy of `docs/` to diverge from
deliberately, which is the only way to adopt the *prose half* of
conformIT at all, not just the audit tooling; there is no reusable-
workflow equivalent for "give me my own copy of your philosophy to
extend."

**What changed to support it:** one hardcoded reference. Every
functional value in `reusable-audit.yml` was already an input or a
`job.*` context value, not literal text, because it was built
parameterized from the start (this decision, above). The one exception
was the "generated by" credit line in the published report README,
which said `almadon/conformIT` as a literal string; a fork's own reports
would have credited upstream instead of themselves. Fixed to read
`job.workflow_repository`, the same context already used for the
checkout step, so it resolves correctly regardless of which copy is
running.

**What this confirms, stated plainly since it's easy to miss**: building
the reusable workflow properly parameterized the first time (no
shortcuts, no "we'll generalize it later") is what made this a five-line
fix instead of a redesign. The cost of that discipline was paid already,
in decision #17's own body above; this addendum is the payoff showing up
one question later.

## 18. Semgrep for the audit's SAST check, CodeQL as a separate opt-in template

The maintainer asked whether "actively scrutinizing the codebase," not
just matching known advisories, was achievable through an existing
library.

**Chosen:** [semgrep](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep) (LGPL-2.1),
integrated into `scripts/lib/audit-checks.sh` the same way as gitleaks:
prefer it on `PATH`, skip the check (not a false pass) when it isn't
there. Two curated open rulesets, `p/security-audit` and
`p/owasp-top-ten`, not `--config=auto` (registry-driven, nudges toward
an account login in newer versions). [CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/)
is offered as a separate template
(`templates/.github/workflows/codeql.yml`) for an adopter's own CI, not
folded into the audit tool.

**Why semgrep for the audit and not CodeQL:** every other check in this
file scans text, line by line, with no build step, uniformly across any
language, which is what makes "clone shallowly, scan, discard" work as
a model at all. Genuine vulnerability scrutiny doesn't share that
property. CodeQL does real dataflow analysis, tracing whether untrusted
input reaches a dangerous sink, not pattern matching, which is why it's
the stronger tool; the cost is that it needs to know how to build the
target, and that configuration is inherently per-repo, not something a
generic "clone anyone's repo" audit can supply. Semgrep's rules mostly
work directly against source text via AST matching, no compile step,
which is the one property that lets it fit conformIT's existing
architecture instead of needing its own.

**Two things confirmed by actually running it against a real fixture,
not assumed from the tool's own marketing:**

1. It works: a synthetic `subprocess.call(..., shell=True)` command-
   injection pattern was correctly caught, with a real rule ID and line
   number, no code content in the report (consistent with every other
   check here).
2. It's real but partial coverage, in the same test: a string-
   concatenated SQL query in the same fixture, run through the same two
   rulesets, was not caught. Recorded in the code comment directly
   above the check, not left implicit: a clean result means "nothing
   these specific rules catch," not "no vulnerabilities."

**A distinct severity choice**: any semgrep finding maps to FAIL, not
CRIT. CRIT is reserved for secrets specifically, per decision #13's own
reasoning (an active, rotate-now response distinct from every other
finding). A static-analysis finding is real but doesn't have that same
"already compromised, act now" shape; treating it the same as a leaked
key would blur a distinction decision #13 deliberately drew.

**A distinct honesty choice**: semgrep's absence maps to WARN, not PASS.
Every other check in this file means "looked, found nothing" when it
passes. Reporting PASS for a check that didn't run would say something
false, and there's no honest heuristic fallback for "contains a SQL
injection" the way the secrets check has one for "looks like an AWS
key" (decision #13); absence here is a real gap, not a graceful
degradation, and the report says so.

**What it cost:** semgrep distributes through PyPI with a real
dependency tree, not a single downloadable binary the way gitleaks is.
Fully hash-pinning it (`pip install --require-hashes`) needs every
transitive dependency hash-pinned too, real, ongoing lockfile
maintenance disproportionate to what it buys here. Pinned the version
instead, without a checksum, and said so plainly in `docs/credits.md`
rather than presenting it as equivalent rigor to gitleaks's verified
download. A 5-minute timeout bounds a pathological target rather than
letting one repo hang the whole run, an operational cost the other
checks don't need since they're all fast, single-pass text scans.

**Verified in real CI the same day**: triggered the workflow by hand
rather than waiting for the schedule. `pip install semgrep==1.175.0`
succeeded on the real runner, the check ran, and correctly reported
`PASS` on conformIT's own codebase, confirmed by reading the actual
published report rather than trusting the green checkmark alone.

**What would justify revisiting:** a false-negative or false-positive
rate from real use that argues for a different ruleset or a different
tool; an adopter wanting CodeQL results folded into the same report as
the rest of the audit, which isn't possible without conformIT
generically configuring per-language builds, itself a much larger
undertaking than this decision took on.

## 19. Portability is a design principle, cited against this project's own lived examples

The maintainer proposed: modularity and portability across ecosystems,
environments, and operating systems should be the default for a
project, unless it's deliberately scoped to one platform.

**Chosen:** [design-principles.md](design-principles.md) rule 11.

**Why with this specific evidence:** the rule cites two things this
project already did, not hypotheticals. Its own scripts and hooks
target bash 3.2 rather than whatever the maintainer's machine runs,
which is why every hook already works identically on macOS and a Linux
CI runner. And decision #17's reusable workflow was built with every
functional value as an input rather than hardcoded to one org, which is
what turned the fork-portability question, asked three sessions later,
into a five-line fix instead of a redesign. Citing your own project's
paid-for discipline back at itself, at the moment someone asks whether
it was worth it, is more convincing than a rule that only points at
other repos.

**Why it doesn't contradict rule 9** ("single-homed until proven
otherwise"): they're different axes. Rule 9 says don't build
operational scale before you need a second node. This rule says don't
hardcode assumptions that make later portability cost a rewrite instead
of a parameter. A project can and should be single-homed *and*
portable: the reusable workflow never scaled to multiple orgs
operationally, it just didn't assume there'd only ever be one.

**What it cost:** nothing new; the cost was already paid and recorded
in the decisions this rule cites. The rule itself costs future design
time on every project that adopts it, stated in its own "Cost" line
rather than left implicit.

**What would justify revisiting:** if a future decision shows the
opposite lesson, portability designed in up front that never paid off
and cost real time against a deadline; nothing like that has happened
here yet.

## 20. Session logs (`chats/`), gitignored by default, checked by the audit

The maintainer proposed a standard, prompted by a discussion elsewhere
this session couldn't locate: AI coding tools should keep a continuous,
human-readable log of significant sessions at
`chats/{tool}/YYYY-MM-DD-{project}-{topic}.md`, gitignored by default.
Asked directly to also wire it into the audit, the same as every other
standard here.

**Chosen:** the path shape and purpose recorded in
[documentation-standard.md](documentation-standard.md) ("Session
logs"), the behavioral rule in
[rules-of-engagement.md](rules-of-engagement.md) rule 10 and both
`AGENTS.md` files (root and template), the exclusion itself in
`.gitignore` (both conformIT's own, newly created, and
`templates/.gitignore`, also new), and a real audit check
(`_conformit_scan_chats_tracked` in `scripts/lib/audit-checks.sh`).

**Why markdown, and why a directory per tool**: a tool-native transcript
format (JSONL, or whatever else) is optimized for that tool reading it
back, not for a human or a different tool's next session doing so. A
project using more than one coding tool gets one subdirectory per tool
rather than a merged log, since two tools' own conventions for what a
session even is don't necessarily line up.

**Why the audit checks `git ls-files`, not just "does a `.gitignore`
exist"**: a `.gitignore` rule added after content was already committed
doesn't retroactively untrack it. Checking for the ignore rule's
presence would pass a repo that has one and also has committed session
logs from before it existed, which is exactly the case worth catching.
`git ls-files chats/` asks git directly what's actually tracked,
sidestepping the question of whether an ignore rule exists at all.

**Why filenames are reported plainly here, unlike the other sensitive-
content checks**: naming a path that's already tracked in the repo
isn't a new disclosure the way echoing a discovered email address or a
secret's value would be (decision #13, #16). The finding's whole point
is telling you which files to `git rm --cached`, and redacting that
would make the report less useful for no privacy gain, since the path
is already visible in the repo's own history to anyone who looks.

**What it cost:** conformIT didn't have a root `.gitignore` at all
before this; the gap existed independently of this decision and was
found while implementing it, not caused by it. This project's own
existing content was checked and has never had a `chats/` directory, so
nothing needed retroactive cleanup here.

**What I could not verify:** where the original conversation proposing
this happened. Searched exhaustively (eleven query variants across
other Claude Code session transcripts, a full session listing, a check
of conformIT's own git history for anything already merged) and found
nothing. The tool used for that search only covers Claude Code
sessions, not claude.ai's own conversation history, which may be where
it actually happened. Implemented from the maintainer's restated
description rather than a recovered record, and said so at the time
rather than presenting the search as more conclusive than it was.

**Verified in real CI the same day, tag `v4`**: triggered the workflow
by hand against conformIT's own repo, which has no `chats/` directory.
The report correctly carried zero mentions of it, confirming the
"silent when not applicable" design holds in a real run and not just in
the local synthetic-fixture tests (absent, present-and-ignored,
present-and-committed) run earlier the same session.

**What would justify revisiting:** a second tool's own session-export
convention turning out to be incompatible with landing inside
`chats/{tool}/` as plain markdown, in which case the format
requirement, not the directory shape, would need to bend.

## 21. Moved to SerenIT-org, and the reporting repo became a template plus an org-owned copy

The maintainer moved conformIT, Consigliere and its fleet template from
the `almadon` account to the `SerenIT-org` organization (2026-10-06), and
renamed the default branch of the moved repos to `main`. conformIT's own
audit workflow and its adopter template both name repositories, so the
move touches CI directly, not just prose.

**Chosen:** every live reference now points at `SerenIT-org`:
`README.md`, `registry/targets.yaml` (`SerenIT-org/conformIT` and
`SerenIT-org/Consigliere`; the `almadon/novak*` targets did not move and
are unchanged), `.github/workflows/audit.yml`, the comments in
`reusable-audit.yml`, and `templates/.github/workflows/conform-audit.yml`
(whose `uses:` line is the one adopters copy). Earlier entries in this
file keep `almadon/...` on purpose: they record what was true when they
were written.

**The reporting repo:** the maintainer's recollection was that it should
be a public template other adopters copy into private repos. It was not
an automated step: the reusable workflow has always required the caller
to create it by hand (it says so in its own input description), and
`almadon/conformIT-reporting` holds real findings, so making that repo
public, or turning it into the template, would defeat decision #16. So
instead: `SerenIT-org/conformIT-reporting-template` is a new public
template repo with nothing but a README explaining the setup, an MIT
licence matching conformIT's, and an empty `reports/`; and
`SerenIT-org/conformIT-reporting` is a private repo created from it for
this org's own audit. `almadon/conformIT-reporting` is untouched.

**What it cost:** one manual step this change cannot do. The fine-grained
token in `CONFORMIT_REPORTING_TOKEN` was scoped to the old reporting repo,
and a token's scope does not follow a repo to a new owner. A new token,
scoped to `SerenIT-org/conformIT-reporting` only with `Contents: Read and
write`, has to replace it (and the organization has to allow fine-grained
tokens), or the publish step fails. Also: callers pinned to
`almadon/conformIT/.github/workflows/reusable-audit.yml@v4` depend on
GitHub redirecting `uses:` references after a transfer, which I did not
verify and would not rely on. A search of the `almadon`, `SerenIT-org`
and `tmeuze` accounts found no such callers other than conformIT itself.
`VERIFY`: the redirect behaviour for `uses:` after a transfer.

**Rejected:** leaving `reporting_repo` pointing at the old private repo
(a cross-organization write with a token that outlives the account it was
scoped for) and transferring that repo as is (it carries the old
findings history into the new org).

**What would justify revisiting:** if reports from several orgs ever need
one shared destination, the per-org private repo split is the thing to
reconsider; nothing suggests that yet.
